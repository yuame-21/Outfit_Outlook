# Outfit Outlook

An application used to forecast the daily and weekly weather in addition to suggesting fashion choices based on
weather data and user preference. Built with Python, SQL, and React.

# Project Status
This project is currently in development. Developers can use routes to relevant weather data through weatherapi.com.
Front-end functionality still in progress.

# Reflection
This was a summer project during the summer before our third year at university. Project goals include using 
technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing ourselves with APIs.
